The `simpleimpl` package comprises a basic implementation of the strategy package, primarily for testing and
demonstration purposes during Phase 2 development.  It is not intended for use in release versions or versions after
Phase 2 (2 Nov 2015).

Note that:
 * `SimpleStockValue` is equivalent to `SimpleMovingAverage` instantiated with `1` as the argument.
 * `SimpleAction` is equivalent to `Action` instantiated with a constant integer argument for quantity.
