Ninja Trader 7

    - Our Product will target beginner audience, who may not necessarily be comfortable 
      with trading or even understand how it works.

    - Ninja Trader targets very advanced users/traders.
      Upon first opening the tool, you're bombarded by 4 windows, and 3
      of which are graphs with obscure red and green lines. While this view is likely familiar to
      an experienced trader, it may be very confusing for others

    - Our product will have a very clear and easy approach to trading and designing
      algorithms for trading and advanced options mostly hidden from users until they're
      ready to be tossed into the deep end.

    - I believe this tool is focused on the advanced users because it appeals to larger
      firms and traders who are experienced with how to trade and know all the terms
      associated with the business. These larger firms invest a lot of money into
      good tools and are willing to pay big bucks for it.

    - In order to help small users and inexperienced users catch up, they focus on directing
      them towards videos, yet still assume that users are knowledgable of all the terms used
      to desribe the market
