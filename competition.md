Ninja Trader 7

    - Our Product will be targetted towards a beginner audience. 
      One that isn't completely comfortable with trading or knows how it works.

    - Ninja Trader is very much targetted towards a very advanced user/trader.
      Upon first opening the tool, you're greeted with a bombardment of 4 windows, 3
      of which are graphs with red and green lines. A view most likely familiar to
      an experienced trader, but very confusing for others

    - Our product will have a very clear and easy approach to trading and designing
      algorithms for trading and advanced options mostly hidden from users until they're
      ready to be tossed into the deep end.

    - I believe this tool is focused on the advanced users because it appeals to larger
      firms and traders who are experienced with how to trade and know all the terms
      associated with the business. These larger firms invest a lot of money into
      good tools and are willing to pay big bucks for it.

    - In order to catch up small users an inexperienced users, they focus on directing
      them towards videos, but still assume users are knowledgable of all the terms used
      to desribe the market
