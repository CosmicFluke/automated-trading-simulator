#Ninja Trader 7

    - Our product focuses on being simple and intuitive to use. It is aimed at users who may not
      be professional traders, and do not have the resources to commit to a software with steep
      learning curve.

    - Ninja Trader targets advanced users/traders.
      The user interface is very complex with many variables and windows to adjust. Extensive
      knowledge about trading and a lot of experience working with trading softwares is required
      to use Ninja Trader with ease.

    - Our product aims for a very clear and easy approach to trading and designing
      algorithms for trading. Advanced options will be made available should a more experienced
      user chooses to enable them.

    - Ninja trader is aimed at large firms and professional traders who are long time trading
      experts. These target audiences usually have high expertise and large quantities of resource
      to devote to trading simulation softwares.

    - In order to help small users and inexperienced users catch up, they focus on directing
      them towards videos, yet still assume that users are knowledgeable of all the terms used
      to describe the market.
      
    - Our product will provide more direct assistance to inexperienced users and non-professionals
      through user-centered design.
