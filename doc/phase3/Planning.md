#Planning
##Initial Planning:
Demo: Bill wanted to have our GUI to be functional enough to demonstrate everything from the creation of strategy and experiment to running and displaying the results of an experiment.

##Re-planning and Adjustments
Towards the end of the last meeting we realized that we cannot implement what we intended. We will instead only implement most important part of our application, which is running experiment and displaying results, and subsequently write a utility class to programmatically construct the strategies that will be used in the experiment.

###Goals that weren't met:
* Working in pairs
* Functional GUI for creating strategy
* Weekly meetings and scrum meetings

##Review and Retrospectives
Even though communication and participation has improved since the last phase, it was still disorganized. This resulted in us not being able to implement the ideal MVP while still being sleep-deprived.
For the next phase I would like to have a very structured Scrum Planning Meeting with detailed meeting minutes, to identify tasks and assign them to group members. I would also encourage group members to hold themselves responsible for completing tasks.
