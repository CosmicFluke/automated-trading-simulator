##Roles:
###Scrum Master: Asher
* Asher has served as the de facto scrum master in phase 2. The role automatically went to him again for phase 3, as we can't imagine anyone else doing the job as well.
* As Scrum Master, Asher regularly performed maintenance on github issues, resolved conflicts when they arose and led meetings.
* Shirley has attempted to assist this role by taking notes and actively creating github issues for tasks planned throughout the meetings
* Shirley has also attempted (sometimes unsuccessfully) to schedule in-person meetings. Due to busy schedules, most of our communication happened online through Slack, our online collaboration tool

##Utilizing the Github Repository and Travis
With a team as large as 6 people, the resulting frequency and complexity of merge conflicts and errors are headache inducing. We came up with a good solution for this problem: branching, rebasing and merging. The idea is that we work on our separate branches, and when we're ready to propagate changes to master, we pull and rebase master to our own branch: which applies our changes on top of the most recent commits in master. If this results in conflicts or Travis failing, then we resolve them and make sure that our branch is error/conflict free before merging it with master.

##Meetings and Planning
We tried to hold meetings on a weekly basis. An example of our meeting minutes is included in the folder.
Originally we intended to split the group into 3 pairs, with each pair working together on a part of the project. However, this never came to fruition. We experienced the same difficulty during the last phase, where we had trouble maintaining communication and finding organization. 
I find that on the occasion that we were able to meet in person, we were highly productive. During face-to-face meetings, there'd no lag in communication and any issue or difficulty faced by weaker programmers can immediately be resolved by members with higher expertise.
 
* Talk about prioritizing tasks and rationale behind decisions
