##Roles:
###Scrum Master: Asher
* Asher has served as the de facto scrum master in phase 2. The role automatically went to him for phase 3, as we can't imagine anyone else doing the job as well as he did.
* As Scrum Master, Asher regularly performed maintenance on github issues, resolved interpersonal conflicts when they arose and led meetings.
* Shirley has attempted to assist this role by taking notes and raising issues throughout the meetings
* Shirley has also attempted (sometimes unsuccessfully) to schedule in-person meetings. Due to busy schedules, most of our communication happened online through Slack, our online collaboration tool
