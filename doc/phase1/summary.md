# Proposal for Algorithmic Trading Simulator

## Objectives:

 Our aim is to create an application which small clients and inexperienced traders can optimize their trading algorithms on. The application will have an UI that takes in a set of algorithms as user-input and run it against historical market data. Our application will make algorithmic trading easy for people with little to no experiences.

## Key Personas

###John the Economic student: 
John has a strong business background and wants to try his hands at algorithmic trading, but before he puts his money on the line, he wants some evidence that his algorithm works. This can only be achieved by running it on historical data. After a long and exhaustive search on the internet, he was not able to find a good tool within a reasonable price range and learning curve to do this.

###Momma Alice:
Alice is mother to two twin boys and working part time as a day trader. Her husband works in sales and frequently engages in day trade as well. However, their income fluctuates due to the unpredictabilty of the market. Alice would like to bring in a more stable income in order to raise their children by improving their trading strategies. In order to do this, Alice must have a good tool to test her algorithms on historical market data.

## Use cases

1. As an economic student user, I want to use a free application before committing to a paid advanced tool to test my hypothesis on historical data. (Priority: high. Difficulty: med) 
2. As a part-time user, I want to learn and build algorithmic trading so that I can become more advanced trader to earn higher and stable profits. (Priority: high. Difficulty: high) 
 
## Key Principals
The application should be easy to use for someone who has a background in trading but minimal programming experience.
We will give user the option to load the historical data of their choice of stock, upload their algorithms and run it against the historical data and to save and modify existing algorithms.
Two major actions in the algorithms are 'buy when <condition>' and 'sell when <condition>
