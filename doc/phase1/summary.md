# Proposal for Algorithmic Trading Simulator

## Objective:

Our aim is to create an application that provides a platform on which non-professional or inexperienced traders can optimize their trading algorithms. The application will have an UI that takes in a set of algorithms as user-input and run it against historical market data. Our application will make algorithmic trading easy for everyone.

## Key Personas

### John the economic student: 
John has a strong business background and taught himself the basics of algorithmic trading through books and online resources. He wants to try the strategies he learned, but before investing his savings, he wants some evidence that his algorithm works. This can  be achieved by testing his algorithms on historical data. However, after a long and exhaustive search on the Internet, he was not able to find a good tool within a reasonable price range and a easy enough learning curve to start with.

### Alice the mom:
Alice is a mother of two boys and a part-time day trader. Her husband works in sales and frequently engages in day trading as well. However, trading takes a lot of time out of their busy lives, and they would really like to automate their rather defined set of strategy with a computer program. With this in mind, they are looking for a easy to use software that can let them try out how it would be like to automate their trades instead of having to watch the market themselves.

## Use cases

1. As an economic student user, I want to use a free, easy to learn application before committing to a paid advanced tool to test my hypothesis on historical data. (Priority: high. Difficulty: med)

2. As a busy user, use a computer program to automate my trades. But before doing so, I want to test my strategies on historical data so I do not make serious mistakes with real money. I do not have experience with trading softwares, so I want something that is easy to use with a shallow learning curve. (Priority: high. Difficulty: high)
 
## Key Principals
1. The application should be easy to use for someone who has a background in trading but minimal programming experience.
2. The application should allow the user to load the historical data of their choice of stock, upload their algorithms and run it against the historical data and to save and modify existing algorithms.
3. Two major actions in the algorithms are 'buy when <condition>' and 'sell when <condition>'.
4. The software should allow algorithms to be created for all kinds of market actions that a trader would want to perform in a real-life trading situation.
