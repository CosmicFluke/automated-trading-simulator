#Organizing the Team:
Our team was formed in class. For our main mode of communication, we decided to use Slack, a popular team collaboration tool equipped with multiuser live chat. 

#Deciding on a topic:
Our idea is the Algorithmic Trading Simulator because we felt that it was not only exciting, original and unlikely to be duplicated by another team but also possessed a lot of value in the real-world.

#Deciding on a programming language:
Java was our choice of programming language since all group members have extensive experiences with it. Most of the course material for csc301 also seem to be based on Java, so we decided to go with the path of least resistance. 

#Meetings and Communications:
Slack has the ability to organize discussions into different channels. Our three main channels are: Project Idea, General and Random.
With the help of slack, we were able to collaborate on the proposal online, familiarize ourselves with one another, and as well as schedule weekly meetings.
Long story short, we utilized both in-person meetings as well as online communication through Slack.

#Lessons for the next phase:
It's easy to get side-tracked in a group meeting. Since time is precious in a six-people meeting, it is expected that we prepare outlines and a record of issues and concerns for all future meetings.
To prevent design mistakes, every group member is expected to do careful research before pushing forward a recommendation for the project.
